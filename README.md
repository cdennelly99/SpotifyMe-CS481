# SpotifyMe

## Summary

SpotifyMe is a React-based Web Application created to provide Spotify users the functionality that Spotify does not! Examples include:  

  - Creating temporary time-based playlists out of your most recently played tracks
    - Some tasks just require a bit of time and a bit of tunes; SpotifyMe takes out the pain of queueing music in the middle of your important time-based tasks (think cardio, timing study sessions, anything where you have limited time to listen to music and you want to make it count!)
    - Have the ability to create these time-limited playlists based around music patterns such as popularity, danceability, acousticness, happiness, BPM, and more
    - Further customize these playlists by searching and adding songs of your choice
  - View all your top tracks, albums, and artists over variable time periods (3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, all time). No need to wait until each December for SpotifyWrapped!

## REACT Guide (CREATE-REACT-APP)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
