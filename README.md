# spotifyme

## Summary

SpotifyMe is a React-based Web Application created to provide Spotify users the functionality that Spotify does not! Examples include:  

  - (WIP) Creating temporary time-based playlists out of your most recently played tracks
    - Some tasks just require a bit of time and a bit of tunes; SpotifyMe takes out the pain of queueing music in the middle of your important time-based tasks (think cardio, timing study sessions, anything where you have limited time to listen to music and you want to make it count!)
  - (WIP) View all your top tracks, albums, and artists over variable time periods (3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, all time). No need to wait until each December for SpotifyWrapped!

  ## IMPORTANT DEV NOTES:
  - Required minimum version of Node.js: 14
